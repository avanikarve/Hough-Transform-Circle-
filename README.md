# Hough Transform for Circle Detection

## Objective  
The aim of this project is to detect circles in an image using the Hough Transform method. The code walks through the process step-by-step and explains how the technique helps identify circular shapes accurately.

## Files  
- `Hough_Circle_AMK.ipynb` – Python notebook containing the complete code along with detailed explanation  
- `test3.0.png` – Test image used for circle detection in the code
